# The Starfield Surveyed Planet Program

## What is this?
I wanted to develop a program that kept track of it manually. Automating the manual part of it as best as possible.

## Why is this?
Good question! At the moment of writing, Starfield doesn't keep track of 100% surveyed planets. I wanted my own personal way of keeping track and I thought this would be a cool project to work on.

## How is this?
Weirdly worded question! This is all done in Python, specifically Python 3.11.1. I haven't used Python a lot, so I figured I would also try it in a language I am not too familar with.

# What is needed to run this?
Listed below will the the requirements:
- [Python 3.11.1 or Later](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/)
- Windows OS

# What do I download!?
Currently the program is available through 'main.exe'. If you are uncomfortable with an .exe file by itself, you are more than welcome to download the entire code and run it/compile it yourself. Otherwise, I will provide a more comfortable folder solution in the future.

# Planned future updates
<ins>***THIS IS STILL A WORK IN DEVELOPMENT AND A PERSONAL PROJECT.***</ins> The rate at which work will be done for it is inconsistant, however feel free to leave suggestions and issues/bugs you have with it. This is my first real Python program, so expect it to not be the most efficient in a lot of places.

Current things I am working on:
- Ability for this to work on Linux/UNIX systems
- Adding moons to planets
- Auto-storing the JSON file when adding a new planet/moon
- Automatically determining if a planet is habitable or not.
